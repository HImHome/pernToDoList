# pernToDoList
This is a Fullstack web application based on the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js) designed to manage To-Do items.
More specifically:

PostgreSQL serves as our database

Express.js is responsible for handling API endpoints

I used React to create the user interface

And finally Node.js is the platform (or runtime enviroment) I used to enable JavaScript to process web requests and interact with the database.
