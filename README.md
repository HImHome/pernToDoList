This is a Fullstack web application, meaning I created both the User Interface and the server-side logic and infrastracture we need for our app to be functional, based on the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js) designed to manage To-Do items.
More specifically:

PostgreSQL serves as our database

Express.js is responsible for handling API endpoints

I used React to create the user interface

And finally Node.js is the platform (or runtime enviroment) I used to enable JavaScript to process web requests and interact with the database.
